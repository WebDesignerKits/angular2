# angular2

Clone the project, and install dependencies
```
git clone https://github.com/WebDesignerKits/angular2
cd angular2/angular2
npm install
```
Start watching your src with Gulp
```
gulp
```
Open a new terminal and start your live server
```
cd live
npm install
npm start
```
Now edit the src code, which automatically builds to the live folder.

The server will run on http://localhost:3000/
